Practical No:2

A]Add a user:
useradd creates a new user account according to the options specified on the command line and the default values set in the /etc/default/useradd file.
useradd [OPTIONS] USERNAME
  $ sudo useradd username

B]Network Settings:
Network settings is essential when installing an ubuntu server. It is useful for troubleshooting problems with your Internet connection. 
netstat –I to find the interface name.
  It displays network connections (both incoming and outgoing), routing tables, and a number of network interface statistics.
sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.72.6 netmask 255.255.255.0.
Then to add a default gateway:
  sudo route add default gw 192.168.72.1 eth0

C]Configure Services
Systemd
$ sudo systemctl status  
  shows status of all services on server
$sudo systemctl status apache2 
  shows status of specific service
$ sudo systemctl start/restart/stop apache2 – start/stop restart service

Service
$sudo service —status-all | less – 
  shows status of services and allows you to scroll through results.
sudo service apache2 status/start/stop/restart – to manage services
Init.d : 
  It contains the bunch of start /stop scripts which are used to control (start,stop,reload,restart) the daemon while the system is running or during boot.

sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 status/start/restart/stop – to manage services


D] Display the list service
  To list all loaded services on your system (whether active; running, exited or failed, use the list-units subcommand and --type switch with a value of service.
$ systemctl list-units --type=service
OR
$ systemctl --type=service

E] Change to static ip address
1. To setup static IP address in Debian
$ nano /etc/network/interfaces
Output:
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp

Change it so it looks like this:
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static 
  address 192.168.0.100
  netmask 255.255.255.0
  gateway 192.168.0.1
  dns-nameservers 4.4.4.4
  dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8
  
2. Save the file and then edit /etc/resolv.conf like this:
# nano /etc/resolv.conf
nameserver 8.8.8.8 # Replace with your nameserver ip
nameserver 4.4.4.4 # Replace with your nameserver ip
3. Restart the networking on your system with:
$ /etc/init.d/network restart  [On SysVinit]
$ systemctl restart network    [On SystemD]

F] Disable IPV6 

1. Open a terminal window.

2. Issue the command sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf

3. Add the following at the bottom of the file:

net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1

net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1

net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1

G] Sudo Setting
  It is mainly used for provide commands execution right for any user or group.
  Only root user has execution right for all commands .
  But normal user have limited commands execution rights

To edit sudo configuration file use:
  $ visudo
The above command will open /etc/sudoers file in an editor. This file is the main configuration file for sudo settings.
