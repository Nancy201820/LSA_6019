Practical No:5
Aim: Install Samba to share folders or files between Windows and linux.

SAMBA:
  Samba is an Open Source Suite, that provides seamless file and print services to SMB/CIFS clients.
    •	Samba is freely available.
    •	With Samba, you can share a Linux files ystem with Windows and vice versa.
    •	You can also share printers connected to either Linux or a system with Windows. 
    •	Samba enables a Linux or Unix server to function as a file server for client PCs running Windows software.
  SMB stands for Server Message Block.
    •	It is a protocol by which a lot of PC-related machines share files and printers and other information such as lists of available files and printers.
    •	Operating systems that support this natively include Windows, OS/2, and Linux.
      
Steps 1: To install Samba, we run:
  $ sudo apt update
  $ sudo apt-get –y  install samba
We can check if the installation was successful by running:
  $whereis samba 
Now start samba service and enable it at startup:
  $ sudo systemctl start smbd
  $ sudo systemctl enable smbd
      
Step 2: Configure File Server 
a. Create a shared folder called “samba_shared”.
  $ mkdir  samba_shared
b. The configuration file for Samba is located at /etc/samba/smb.conf. To add the new directory as a share, we edit the file by running:
  $ sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
  
At the bottom of the file, add the following lines:
[sambashare]
    comment = Samba on Ubuntu
    path = /home/username/sambashare
    read only = no
    browsable = yes
    
c. Now that we have our new share configured, save it and restart Samba for it to take effect:
  $sudo service smbd restart
  
d. Add user in Samba
  $sudo smbpasswd –a username
Modify Permission
  $chmod 777 /home/kali/samba_shared
e. Update the firewall rules to allow Samba traffic:
  $sudo ufw allow samba
  
Step 3: Access Samba shared files
Now we need to access what we’ve shared. We can use the smbclient utility to access Windows shared files. We can list the shared files like this:
  $ smbclient -L localhost -U%  
  
Step 4: Creating Samba users
a.To create a samba entry for an existing system user, use the pdbedit command:
  $ pdbedit -a kali
The new user will be created in the Samba default user database which is /var/lib/samba/private/passdb.tdb file.

b. With a Samba user created, we can make the shares available only to authenticated users,
This user can access his resources on Samba server using smbclient like this:
  $ smbclient -U kali -L //192.168.1.3
  
c. Restart now
  $sudo systemctl restart smbd
  $sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.3/24 to any samba
  
d. Adding rule
  $sudo ufw reload
