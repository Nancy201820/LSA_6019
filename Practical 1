Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP is a network protocol that is used to enable host computers to be automatically assigned IP addresses and related network 
configurations from a server.
Step 1: Installing DHCP Server in Ubuntu
$ sudo apt install isc-dhcp-server
Step 2: When the installation completes, edit the file 
/etc/default/isc-dhcp-server
 to define the interfaces DHCPD should use to serve DHCP requests, with the 
INTERFACES option.
Step 3: The main DHCP configuration file is /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf,add all your network information to be sent to clients here.
Step 4: Now, open and modify the main configuration file, define your DHCP server options:
$ sudo vi /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
Step 5: Now, define a subnetwork; here, weâ€™ll setup DHCP for 192.168.10.0/24 LAN network (use parameters that apply to your scenario).
